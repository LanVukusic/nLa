    Status of this memo

    <div class="inset">
      This document provides an open specification for implementing Wi-Fi
      hotspots in dormitory environments, aimed at standardizing the process of
      connecting users to local wireless networks. The goal of this RFC is to
      outline the technical requirements, design considerations, and best
      practices for setting up and managing hotspot connectivity in shared
      residential spaces. It offers guidelines for ensuring secure, reliable,
      and efficient access to wireless networks, catering specifically to the
      unique needs and challenges faced in dormitories, such as handling high
      user density, ensuring fair bandwidth distribution, and maintaining
      security and privacy for all users.

    Abstract

    <div class="inset">
      This document defines nLa <b>nLa Libre Access-point</b>, a Wi-Fi hotspot
      solution for dormitory environments. nLa operates using the IEEE 802.11n
      Wi-Fi standard and comes pre-configured with a default password of
      <b>tugicamalo</b>. It provides a straightforward, high-speed connection
      for shared living spaces. This RFC outlines the technical specifications
      and deployment guidelines for implementing nLa effectively.

    Technical specification

    <div class="inset">
      <p>
        The nLa Libre Access-point must utilize Wi-Fi technology compliant with
        at least IEEE 802.11n (from the 802.11b/g/n family), with a strong
        recommendation for 5 GHz frequency band operation where available to
        maximize throughput and minimize interference in high-density
        environments. Lower bands (e.g., 2.4 GHz) are supported but discouraged
        in favor of higher efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        For security and compatibility purposes, WPA2-Personal (Wi-Fi Protected
        Access 2) encryption is mandated as the default authentication protocol.
        Implementations that prioritize enhanced security may adopt
        WPA3-Personal, although care should be taken to ensure backward
        compatibility with legacy devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default network password must be set to "tugicamalo" and made
        publicly available to ensure secure encrypted wireless transmission
        while maintaining open access for all users familiar with the nLa
        specification. This password requirement ensures basic encryption (to
        prevent unencrypted data transmissions) while still facilitating a
        low-barrier entry for users.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to note that internet access via the nLa hotspot is not
        guaranteed or required. Implementations may limit connectivity to local
        area network (LAN) communications only, supporting peer-to-peer data
        transfer and device networking within the local domain. This
        functionality is particularly suited for environments where internet
        access is either unavailable or unnecessary.
      </p>
